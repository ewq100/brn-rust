# brn-ai

Thin, fixed ChatGPT/Copilot subscription authentication over Rig **0.43.0**.
This Task 1 foundation contains account/selection DTOs, safe errors, checked
credential storage and owned clients. It does not contain workers, streaming,
tools, SQL, selection persistence or frontend state.

## Authentication contract

- Share one `Arc<Auth>` for an application's explicit credential directory.
  The directory must be absolute, outside Git repositories, real (including
  ancestors), current-user-owned and exactly `0700`. Its parent must already
  exist. A missing directory is created; an unsafe existing directory is refused,
  not repaired. Unix filesystem checks are currently the supported platform.
- Known caches must be regular, single-link, current-user-owned `0600` files.
  Every operation rechecks its provider's paths. Checked reads and permission
  changes use no-follow file descriptors and compare opened inode/device identity.
  Initial `0644` caches are refused; only files written during an authentication
  operation are tightened afterward.
- Only explicit `connect` enables the real Rig device flow. It always supplies
  `DeviceCodeHandler::new`, never Rig's code-printing fallback. The callback
  receives only the URL and code for the active, transient login surface.
  `LoginPrompt` and `ProviderClient` deliberately have no `Debug`.
- Authentication/refresh holds only the target provider's Tokio mutex.
  Authentication success, error and token cancellation all finalize permissions
  before releasing it; a tightening failure returns `UnsafeCredentials`, overriding
  success or an earlier error. Dropping an auth future also attempts synchronous
  tightening under its guard; prefer cancel-and-await so failures can be reported.
- `client` captures a concrete authenticated Rig client and a cloned `Selection`,
  with **no Auth borrow, mutex guard or retained authenticator**.
  `ProviderClient::selection()` exposes the frozen selection. Task 3 consumes
  `ProviderClient.inner` / `auth::OwnedClient` within this crate: a boxed
  `openai::OpenAI` on the ChatGPT dialect, or `copilot::Copilot`.
- `disconnect` serializes cache deletion with authentication/refresh and removes
  only `chatgpt.json` / `chatgpt-name.json`, or `github-token` / `copilot.json` /
  `copilot-name.json`. Authenticators are operation-local, so there is no retained
  provider auth state to recreate a deleted cache.
  **Task 5 must first fence new target-provider jobs, cancel/join active
  login/refresh/discovery/turn jobs, finalize the turn and drop owned clients.**
  `Auth` itself does not implement worker dispatch or streaming cancellation.

## Status, names and models

`status` never sends HTTP. `connected` means locally saved credential material,
including expired credentials; it does not promise upstream validity. Missing
identity is `name: None`; callers must display **“account name unavailable”**,
not infer an identity or switch accounts. ChatGPT's email is decoded from the
cached `id_token` **for display only**, not as authorization proof. On Copilot
Connect, an authenticated GitHub `/user` request uses the same Rig transport as
authentication. Provider-specific display metadata is stored only in `0600`
files in the credential directory, never SQL.

ChatGPT models are a maintained subscription list: currently only `gpt-5.5`,
`live_qualified: false`. Its broken upstream `list_models` is never called.
Copilot discovery authenticates with device flow disabled, releases the auth
mutex, then calls Rig's real `list_models`. Discovery failures are returned
without a substitute list/model/provider; all returned options remain locally
unqualified until separately authorized live acceptance.

`Selection::validate()` rejects invalid identifiers and ChatGPT models outside
the maintained list. Copilot discovery membership and atomic persistence as one
`ai.selection` setting belong to workflow. There is no implicit selection.
Cancellation returns safe `Other`; the worker uses its cancellation token and
job identity to classify interruption. No operation automatically retries an
expired device code: `CodeExpired` supplies safe Retry copy for an explicit new
Connect action.

## Errors and offline verification

`AiError` contains only a kind and optional bounded unsigned reset delay (at most
365 days). Display uses static copy; no raw diagnostic, HTTP body, source chain,
token or device code is retained. Typed HTTP status takes priority: 401/403
reconnect, 429 rate limit; only allowlisted machine codes imply model refusal or
login expiry. Response-less transport failures map to Network. Cache safety,
storage and login-expiry failures remain distinct. Rig's fixed ChatGPT
string-wrapped auth failures are interpreted narrowly and immediately discarded.

Transport injection is crate-private and test-only (`Auth::with_http`); tests
exercise the **real pinned authenticators** with synthetic Rig HTTP transports.
There is no production fake-provider feature or dynamic provider registry.

```sh
# Run from the workspace root; use a dedicated synthetic TMPDIR outside the repo.
TMPDIR=/Users/evokessler/.copilot/session-state/ac00865b-1105-4770-b188-4cb7de10800f/files/chat-test-tmp \
  cargo test -p brn-ai --lib --locked --offline
cargo clippy -p brn-ai --all-targets --locked --offline -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo tree --workspace --all-features --locked --offline -i ort
cargo tree --workspace --all-features --locked --offline -i libsqlite3-sys
```

The facade enables only `agent`, `derive`, `reqwest`; TLS is enabled directly on
`rig-core` and `rig-reqwest`. Never add facade TLS/fastembed/SQLite features.
This preserves the [spike's pinned dependency graph](../../experiments/rig-spike/FINDINGS.md).
Offline tests do not qualify live authentication, native UI, server-side
cancellation or billing behavior.
